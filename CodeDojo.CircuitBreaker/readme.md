# Circuit Breakers

To quote Martin Fowler:

> It's common for software systems to make remote calls to software running in different processes, probably on different machines across a network.

>One of the big differences between in-memory calls and remote calls is that remote calls can fail, or hang without a response until some timeout limit is reached.

>What's worse if you have many callers on a unresponsive supplier, then you can run out of critical resources leading to cascading failures across multiple systems.

>In his excellent book Release It, Michael Nygard popularized the Circuit Breaker pattern to prevent this kind of catastrophic cascade.


Circuit breakers are very simple - they:

* Wrap a protected function call in a circuit breaker object, which monitors for failures.
* Once the failures reach a certain threshold, the circuit breaker trips
* Further calls to the circuit breaker return with an error without the protected call being made at all.
* After a time limit, the circuit enters a "half-open" state
  * While half-open, the next call is allowed through
  * If the call succeeds, the circuit closes
  * If the call fails, the circuit opens and a timer is reset

A circuit breaker has three states, and is modeled after electrical circuits

* Closed - A closed circuit sends requests naturally
* Open - Automatically returns an error when a call is attempted.
* Half open - After a timeout, a open circuit becomes "half open" allowing a single call through

## Story - Implement a circuit breaker

    As a systems maintainer
    I want my calls to be resilient to failure
    So I don't need to turn features on and off

        - Implement the circuit breaker pattern
        - Fault tolerance should be configurable
        - Half-open timeouts should be configurable


### Scenario 1 - Monitoring failure

    As a developer
    I want to count failures when I make calls
    A failure count is incremented

### Scenario 2 - Opening a circuit

    As a developer
    When my failure count exceeds a configured tolerance
    All subsequent calls throw an exception and block the call

### Scenario 3 -  Half opened state

    As a developer
    When my code is blocking calls and a configured timeout passes
    I allow a single call to proceed

        - Single call succeeding closes circuit
        - Single call failing resets some kind of timeout
